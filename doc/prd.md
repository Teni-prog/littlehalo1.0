What are you building?
`I am building a marketplace platform for newcomer families in canada. It's a babysitting platform that connects parents with local babysitters who speak their language or are of the same culture. The parents are able to select the babysitters based on their needs, like if they have kids with special needs as well, and they can select what micro activity they want the babysitter to do with the child instead of them just booking the babysitter for hours just to watch the child sleep. They actually try to have educational activities with them so you get you money's worth but that's completely optional. We try to make you feel as comfortable and as safe as when booking a babysitter. We provide backgroud checks and Id verification on each babysitter, we provide reviews from previous parents to help them make a decision and we also provide you with the babysitter's creditials, so you can have a better idea of who you're booking. Later in the future, we hope to add a video chat feature, so you can actually see the babysitter before booking them.`

What problem you're solving
`We are solving the problem of newcomer families that have to be on childcare waitlist for 9 to 12 months before the child get accepted to school. We are solving the problem of newcomer families that dont have to uit their job to take care of their child. We are solving the problem of newcomer families that dont have to use hours or probably days to search for babysitters; we offer top matched based on your needs. We are solving the problem of newcomer families that wonder how they will adjust to the new system here. We are solving the problem of newcomer families that feel like they dont have anyone here. We are solving the problem of newcomer families that feel unsure or unsafe when booking a babysitter.`

Who are you building for
`We are focusing the initial release on newcomer families (immigrants and not refugees) in Atlantic Canada but really anyone(locals) can use it.`

What are the main MVP features
`The main MVP features are
- Micro-adventures library
- Booking system
- Babysitter matching system (no ai tho)
- verification and background check system
- reviews and rating system
- Geo-location map search 
- secure payment system
`

How do you want user's to use it ?
`I want the users to be able to log in, add the family description, we offer top matched babysitters based on the family description, they can also search for sitter they feel comfortable with, filter based on price, language, location, availability. For the sitters, they can log in and add their description, add their micro-adventures, add their availability, add their price, add their language, add their location, add their credentials, add their background check, add their reviews and ratings. They are not allowed to accept bookings until they are verified and background checked. They are not allowed to accept services outside the platform. Parents are also not allowed to book outside the platform. At the end of the month, who ever does the most hours get a $50 reward.
